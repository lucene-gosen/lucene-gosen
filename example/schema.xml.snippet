    <!-- configuration for japanese text, using a morphological analyzer
      Most possibilities for customization are specified here in the schema.

      Note: you can set the default query operator to be OR, AND, or PHRASE:
       OR: Use these defaults (autoGeneratePhraseQueries="false", <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="OR"/>
           In this case Solr works like it does with the English language. The default query is OR,
           but documents that contain more of the query terms get a special boost. You can probably
           use a less aggressive stopwords/stoptags in this case.
       AND: Set autoGeneratePhraseQueries=false, but set <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="AND"/> in
           your schema.xml. Note if you do this, you should use a more aggressive stopwords/stoptags
           list (at least at query-time), otherwise a document might not match simply because it does
           not contain a prefix or particle.
       PHRASE: Set autoGeneratePhraseQueries=true. If you do this, you should probably use both a very
           aggressive stopwords list. Otherwise, even documents that contain the query's phrase in exact order will
           not match because of slightly different grammatical structure.
